# Forecasting
Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends.
 Forecasting methods:-
1)	If there are no data available, or if the data available are not relevant to the forecasts, then qualitative forecasting methods must be used.
2)	Quantitative forecasting can be applied when two conditions are satisfied:
a)	numerical information about the past is available
b)	it is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future.
Forecasting model building methods:-
1)	Linear model
2)	Exponential model
3)	Quadratic model
4)	Additive seasonality 
5)	Additive seasonality with quadratic trend	
6)	Multiplicative Seasonality
	

Data Used :
1)	Airlines dataset :- Forecast the data and find the RMSE value for each model.Find the best model for forecasting.
2)	Coca cola sales raw dataset :- :- Forecast the data and find the RMSE value for each model.Find the best model for forecasting.
3)	Plastic sales dataset :-  Forecast the data and find the RMSE value for each model.Find the best model for forecasting.

Programming:- Python
